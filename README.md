## Overview and Origin

**Taavet Hinrikus**, one of the founding members of Skype, met **Kristo Kaarman**, a former Deloitte consultant, at a party in London. After talking, they realized they were both facing similar issues with the fact both of them had to do financial transactions from and to Estonia, where they were both originally from. Taavet got his salary paid in Euros in an Estonian account and needed to convert it into Pounds, on the other way around, Kristo had to pay for mortgage in Euros in Estonia, but his money was all in Pounds. Every month they would top off each others accounts in Estonia and Great Britain using the actual exchange rates for the day. This saved them from spending a lot of money in transaction and hidden fees that the banks usually chage for converting money around the world. It was only then that they thought this idea could actually help a a lot more people that were facing a current situation as they were back then and this is how **TransferWise Ltd** started in the year of **2010**. Since its inception, TransferWise Ltd has had 7 funding runs totaling over **$396 million dollars**.

## Business Activities:

TransferWise uses the *mid-market rate* for currency conversion, plus a pre-established conversion fee. Banks and other financial institutions usually embed markup fees into their conversion rates in such way the customer can never really understand what he is paying for. It is not unusual for these institutiions to claim a 0% fee over their transactions in order to alure a customer to do business with them, however, these fees are usually included in the currency exchange rates as *hidden cost*. The mid-market rate is the most transparent rate that can be used for currency conversion as it is the average between the lowest and highest traded rates in a given period. Customers have easy access to it as it is usually the rate that will appear in search tools like Google.

Let's say we want to convert 1,000 British Pounds into Euros. If the mid-market rate is 1.43 Euro per Pound, technically you should get 1,430.00 Euros. However, by doing this transaction with a regular financial institution you would get a rate of 1.37, totalling in 1,370.00 Euros. You just lost 60 Euros in this transaction as hidden cost:

The company targets anyone who needs to make wire-transfers between 40 countries. Expats are probably the main source of income for the company as the transfers might be more relevant than a tourist, for example. According to the source FEEDBACQ, as of 2013, there were 230 million expatriates in the world, with an estimated remmitance of $440 Billion of US Dollars per year.

 the firm achieves this by matching people transferring money in one direction with people transferring it in the other - so called peer-to-peer transfers

The company leverages on Peer-to-Peer transfers by matching people sending money in one direction with people sending money in the other direction, avoiding the exposure to exchange rates fluctuation and taxes. According to the TransferWise [profile](https://stackshare.io/transferwise/transferwise) in stackshare.com, it currently uses different programming languages such as HTML5 and Java, different utlitilies such as Google Analytics and Amazon CloudFront, and several development and research tools such as GitHub and Logstash .
