## Overview and Origin

**Taavet Hinrikus**, one of the founding members of Skype, met **Kristo Kaarman**, a former Deloitte consultant, at a party in London. After talking, they realized they were both facing similar issues with the fact both of them had to do financial transactions from and to Estonia, where they were both originally from. Taavet got his salary paid in Euros in an Estonian account and needed to convert it into Pounds, on the other way around, Kristo had to pay for mortgage in Euros in Estonia, but his money was all in Pounds. Every month they would top off each others accounts in Estonia and Great Britain using the actual exchange rates for the day. This saved them from spending a lot of money in transaction and hidden fees that the banks usually chage for converting money around the world. It was only then that they thought this idea could actually help a lot more people that were facing a current situation as they were back then and this is how **TransferWise Ltd** started in the year of **2010**. Since its inception, TransferWise Ltd has had 7 funding runs totaling over **$396 million dollars**.

## Business Activities:

TransferWise uses the *mid-market rate* for currency conversion, plus a pre-established conversion fee. Banks and other financial institutions usually embed markup fees into their conversion rates in such way the customer can never really understand what they are paying for. It is not unusual for these institut    ions to claim a 0% fee over their transactions in order to allure a customer to do business with them, however, these fees are usually included in the currency exchange rates as *hidden cost*. The mid-market rate is the most transparent rate that can be used for currency conversion as it is the average between the lowest and highest traded rates in a given period. Customers have easy access to it as it is usually the rate that will appear in search tools like Google.

Let's say we want to convert 1,000 British Pounds into Euros. If the mid-market rate is 1.43 Euro per Pound, technically you should get 1,430.00 Euros. However, by doing this transaction with a regular financial institution you would get a rate of 1.37, totalling in 1,370.00 Euros. You just lost 60 Euros in this transaction as hidden cost:

The company targets anyone who needs to make wire-transfers between 40 countries. Expats are probably the main source of income for the company as the transfers might be more relevant than the ones made by tourists, for example. According to the source FEEDBACQ, as of 2013, there were 230 million expatriates in the world, with an estimated remmitance of $440 Billion of US Dollars per year.

 TransferWise provides services at a competitive rate by matching people transferring money in one direction with people transferring it in the other - so called peer-to-peer transfers. By doing so, TransferWise can avoid the exposure to exchange rates fluctuation and international cash remmitance taxes, that can be a significant amount, depending on the countries envolved in the transaction. According to the TransferWise [profile](https://stackshare.io/transferwise/transferwise) in stackshare.com, it currently uses different programming languages such as HTML5 and Java, different utlitilies such as Google Analytics and Amazon CloudFront, and several development and research tools such as GitHub and Logstash .

## Landscape:

Transferwise operates in the Peer-to-peer transfer and credit domain, although customers do not have any interface with the peers involved in the transactions. After requesting an international wire transfer, the customer is requested to deposit the amounts to a national TransferWise bank account. TrasnferWise then will use one of its bank accounts located in the country the sender wants to send money to, and from there the cash will be transferred to the bank account the sender requested. Technically the money sent and received is never cross-boarding the countries, thus no taxes apply.

According to a CNBC report, fintech companies accounted for 38 percent of all US personal loans in 2018. This represented a significant growth from merely 5 percent accounted for in the year of 2013. One of the revolutionary aspects of the P2P FinTech disruptions over the past few years was the easement of access to credit, specially for people that had a bad credit history or low income. As traditional banks often require good credit history and guarantees for loan repayments, FinTech companies are more flexible on those requirements as they can use technology to better analyze its customers and their likelyhood of repayment. A good example of FinTech comapanies that utilizes flexible access to credit by P2P loans is ZestFinance. It uses unconventional metrics to underwrite loans to those with low credit scores or thin credit histories. Example: Borrowers who enter their name in all caps in the online application are poorer risks. Zest was chosen to underwrite loans on big Chinese retail site JD.com

In terms of competition, TransferWise currently has 7 major FinTech companies that are also specialized in international remmitances. Although all of them offer more attactive rates than traditional financial institutions, TransferWise seems to have more credibility as it has the biggest [TrustPilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/transferwise.com) rates among them.

## Results

Currently TransferWise has helped more than 5 million people saving money while performing international remmitances by providing its customers a fair exchange rate and minimal fees. It is not only providing its customers with easy money transfer but since 2018 it started to offer other solutions, such as a bordless debit card, that its customers can use to buy in 40 different countries, and also a boardless bank account. 


## Recommendations

As of now, TransferWise has been pioneer in offering different solutions for immigrants, expats and travellers on money remmitance and spend in different countries. As things evolve quickly in the FinTech field, it woud be nice to see what else the company can offer its customers in order to differentiate them from competitors. A possible innovation would be the offering of loans, that could be capitalized in different countries, taking advanage of countries that have lower rates and allocating those resources to countries with bigger rates. Also the company could dig deeper into the B2B markert and maybe offer international payroll services to multi-national companies, where the payroll could run in an specific country and currency and then be allocated to each individual around the world.
